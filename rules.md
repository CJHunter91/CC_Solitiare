shuffle the cards
place a card face up and lay 6 cards face down (7 total)
place a card face up in the second position and lay the rest face down 
contiue to there is a card face up in each column
draw pile not available until first click

a card can only be moved on to another card if -1 of the target card.
exceptions 
  kings can move to empty columns
  if an ace is placed in one of the four suit piles cards of +1 can be placed on them

helpful game logic
  maybe worth making playable cards a playable interface.
  cards that can be moved are the last item in the array i.e stack structure
  the draw pile card that is available could be calculated using a counter
    - i.e the card displayed has an index of the counter

Create the new game board(newGame)
  -clear all arrays
  -create a deck from Deck class()
  -iterate through the game Stacks
  -implement a count to add the correct number of cards to each stack
  -when adding the last card to each stack reveal it
  -reveal the first card from the remainder of the deck (variable deckCard)

Move a card on click
  -check there is an available move
  -MVP pick the first move from moves array
  -create a temp array with the cards to move
  -remove the cards from the array taken from 
  -add the cards to the end of the target array

Click on ace spot(moveToAce)
  -check the size of the array for the specific suit
  -check if there is a value +1 greater available
  -use similar logic(as move a card) to move target card to ace stack
  -if size is >= 13 don't do anything.

To Check for moves for specific card(get_Moves)
  -iterarte through each game stack
  -use the size of the array to get the last item
  -check the last item is +1 greater than target card
  -add to get moves array


To get the next card in the deck pile
  -when clicked add one to the counter
  -update by using the index of the deck
  -loop back to 0 when >than size of the array

Check the game is won when size of all ace stacks are == 13
